    Analyze the following git diff for the file '{filename}'. 

    Focus only on:
    1. Copy-paste errors: Look for actual repeated code blocks or patterns that suggest copy-pasting, ignoring the '+' and '-' at the start of lines.
    2. Spelling issues: Identify any misspelled words or typos in comments and strings. Ignore variable names, function names, and other code identifiers.

    Use the following emoji system to indicate the severity of issues:
    ðŸŸ¢ - No issues found
    ðŸŸ¡ - Minor issues (e.g., a few typos or small repeated code segments)
    ðŸ”´ - Significant issues (e.g., large blocks of copied code or numerous spelling errors)

    Start your response with one of these emojis to indicate the overall status.
    Then provide a concise summary of findings, if any. If no issues are found, just state that.
