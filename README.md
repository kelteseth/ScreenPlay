Because every operating system has its own version of desktop environment we need to adapt the ScreenPlayWindow for every platform 
separately. The most feature complete for now is Windows 10. Windows 7 works but the wallpaper have the [wrong coordinates](https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay/issues/34). MacOS has some basic wallpaper functionality but no maintainer. For Linux we sadly have no support for any desktop environments at the moment, except basic KDE support.

__If you want to help and add new desktop environments look at ScreenPlayWallpaper/src folder__

* [BaseWindow](https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay/blob/dev/ScreenPlayWallpaper/src/basewindow.h) baseclass for:
    * [LinuxWindow](https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay/blob/dev/ScreenPlayWallpaper/src/linuxwindow.h)
    * [WinWindow](https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay/blob/dev/ScreenPlayWallpaper/src/winwindow.h)
    * [MacWindow](https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/ScreenPlay/blob/dev/ScreenPlayWallpaper/src/macwindow.h)
